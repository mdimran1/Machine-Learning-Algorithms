### An “algorithm” in machine learning is a procedure that is run on data to create a machine learning “model.” Machine learning algorithms perform “pattern recognition.” Algorithms “learn” from data, or are “fit” on a dataset. There are many machine learning algorithms.
## List of Continuous/ numerical Machine Learning Algorithms:
* Linear Regression.
* Polynomial Regression.
* Non-linear Regression.
## Classification ML :
* Knn (K nearest neighbours) 
* Decision Tree.
* Logistic Regression.
* SVM ( Support Vector Machine)
* 
* K-Means.
* Random Forest
