##An “algorithm” in machine learning is a procedure that is run on data to create a machine learning “model.” Machine learning algorithms perform “pattern recognition.” Algorithms “learn” from data, or are “fit” on a dataset. There are many machine learning algorithms.
##List of Common Machine Learning Algorithms:
* Linear Regression.
* Logistic Regression.
* Decision Tree.
* SVM.
Naive Bayes.
kNN.
K-Means.
Random Forest.
